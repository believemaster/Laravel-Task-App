# Laravel-Task-App
While Learning PHP I moved ahead and learned it's framework side by side to ease out the use of old codes and simplify the work like Django does using python. I've worked on django also so it was easy for me to understand another MVC and create simplistic websites as such maybe I'll create another one (One last with laravel)
