# Laravel-Task-App
While Learning PHP I moved ahead and learned it's framework side by side to ease out the use of old codes and simplify the work like **Django** does using **python**. I've worked on django also so it was easy for me to understand another **MVC** and create simplistic websites as such maybe I'll create another one.(One last with laravel)

## Set-ups
make sure you setup your `.env` file with the database name and password and make database table for the task also don't forget to run `php artisan make:igration` and run `php artisan serve`  to run the application.

> Django vs Laravel ?? which one's better ....still a mystery because both works great on there way.
